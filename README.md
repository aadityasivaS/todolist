# Todolist

A todolist app created with flutter and firebase.
To build this app from the source code do the following steps:

1. Get the dependencies `flutter pub get`
2. You will see that there is only the android directory it is because I built this app for android only. If you want to do for any other platform see this https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/overview#platform-setup
3. Add firebase to the project https://firebase.flutter.dev/docs/overview
